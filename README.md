# GuiAppExample
# ImGui + OpenGL3 + GLAD + GLFW
### ImGui is a gui library. Many backends such as opengl3 can be ported into ImGui
### OpenGL3 is a graphics API. It does not provide any window, handle user inputs or any of the fancy gui things. Its only job is to write to a buffer for the graphics card
### GLFW provides window, handling user input and other gui things.
### GLAD provides the API functions from OpenGL3 specific to the platform OpenGL3 is currently running on.
